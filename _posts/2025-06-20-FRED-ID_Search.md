If youâ€™ve ever struggled to locate the correct time series on [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org), especially during an exam or class project, this guide is for you. Knowing the exact **FRED Series ID** (e.g., `LNS12000000` for total employment 16+) can save you time and reduce confusion.

Below are **four quick and reliable ways** to find the correct FRED Series ID using either keywords or direct search techniques.

## 1. Use FREDâ€™s Built-In Search (Smart Keyword Method)

Go to [FREDâ€™s homepage](https://fred.stlouisfed.org) and enter a simple keyword in the search bar:

Examples:
- `median house price`
- `cpi shelter`
- `employment 16 and over`

FRED will show you a list of suggested series with their IDs in parentheses.

**Example:**
- Search: `employment 16 and over`
- Result: `LNS12000000 - Employment Level: 16 years and over`

This is the most user-friendly and intuitive option.

## 2. Use the FRED Series Directory (Master Spreadsheet)

You can browse a full list of FRED series from this spreadsheet:

ðŸ“Ž [FRED Series Directory (All IDs)](https://files.stlouisfed.org/fred-md/)

Once opened:
- Use `Ctrl+F` or `Cmd+F` to search by keywords like `median`, `PCE`, `unemployment`, etc.
- Columns include: ID, Title, Frequency, Units, and Source

**Example:**
- Search: `median`
- Result: `MSPUS - Median Sales Price of Houses Sold for the United States`

## 3. Use Google Smart Search

Just Google your term using this format:
- `site:fred.stlouisfed.org [your search term]`

yaml
Copy

**Examples:**
- `site:fred.stlouisfed.org median sales price house series id`
- `site:fred.stlouisfed.org employment level 16+`

Youâ€™ll usually get a direct link to the FRED page with the series ID in the URL or page title.

## 4. Build Your Own Cheat Sheet (Highly Recommended for Exams)

Make a small table with the most common series you'll use in macro or finance classes:
