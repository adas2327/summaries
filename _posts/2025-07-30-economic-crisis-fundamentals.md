# 📘 Module 4 Study Guide – The 2008 Financial Crisis

## 🧩 SECTION 1: BANK BALANCE SHEETS & RISKS

### 1.1 Stylized Bank Balance Sheet

| **Assets**                    | **Liabilities**             |
|------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Currency                     | Deposits                   |
| Reserves                     | Loans from Other Banks     |
| U.S. Treasuries              | Loans from Central Bank    |
| Short-Term Loans / Repos     | Other Loans (e.g., bonds)  |
| Long-Term Assets (e.g., ABS) | Equity                     |

### 1.2 Major Risks

| **Risk**               | **Condition**                                             | **Basel III Rule**                                               |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Capital Inadequacy     | Asset values fall **→** not enough Equity to cover losses     | $$\\frac{Equity}{Long\\text{-}Term\\ Assets} \\geq 8\\%$$         |
| Liquidity Risk         | Liquid assets **<** Depositor Withdrawals                     | $$Currency + Reserves + Treasuries + STA > 5\\% \\times Deposits$$ |
| Stable Funding Risk    | Long-term assets funded by short-term liabilities         | $$Deposits + LT\\ Liabilities + Equity > LT\\ Assets$$             |

### 🔍 Liquid Assets vs Stable Funding

| **Term**           | **Meaning**                                | **Examples**                         |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **Liquid Assets**  | Assets that can be sold or accessed quickly | Cash, Reserves, U.S. Treasuries      |
| **Stable Funding** | Liabilities that are unlikely to disappear suddenly | Deposits, Long-Term Liabilities, Equity |

## 🔁 SECTION 2: HOW BANKS FAIL – SIGNAL FLOW

**Capital Inadequacy Risk**

**↓** Long-Term Asset Value  
**→** **↓** Total Asset Value  
**→** If Equity **<** Losses  
**→** Bank becomes insolvent  

**Liquidity Risk**

**↑** Withdrawals  
**→** Need for Liquid Assets  
**→** If Cash/Treasuries **<** Withdrawals  
**→** Forced Sale of LT Assets **→** Fire Sale **→** **↓** Asset Prices  

**Stable Funding Risk**

**↑** Short-Term Borrowing  
**→** Can’t Refinance in Crisis  
**→** Insolvency or default risk **↑**  

## 💥 SECTION 3: CONTAGION MECHANISMS

| **Contagion Channel**        | **Trigger**                                       | **Impact**                            |
|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Loan Default                | Bank A cannot repay interbank loan from Bank B    | Bank B takes a loss **→** **↓** Capital        |
| Fire Sale                   | One bank sells LT Assets                          | Market value **↓** **→** Other banks mark down |
| Wholesale Lending Freeze    | Interbank market dries up                         | Borrowing banks fail to refinance      |
| CDS Insurer Failure         | Insurer (e.g., AIG) collapses                     | Banks lose insurance **→** Exposure **↑**      |

## 💼 SECTION 4: FED BALANCE SHEET OPERATIONS

### 4.1 Repos & Reverse Repos

| **Tool**           | **Effect on Fed Balance Sheet**         | **Purpose**                           |
|--------------------|------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Repo (Fed Buys)    | **↑** Assets (Repo), **↑** Reserves (Liability)  | Inject liquidity, lower FFR            |
| Reverse Repo (Sell)| **↓** Assets (RRP), **↓** Reserves               | Remove liquidity, raise FFR            |

### 4.2 Quantitative Easing (QE)

QE **→** Fed buys risky or long-term assets  
**→** **↑** Bank Reserves  
**→** **↑** Liquidity  
**→** **↓** Long-Term Yields  

**Used when:**  
- Fed Funds Rate = Floor (IORB)  
- OMOs ineffective in stimulating credit  

## 🏦 SECTION 5: MONETARY POLICY FRAMEWORK

### Corridor vs Floor System

| **Corridor System**                      | **Floor System**                                 |
|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Scarce Reserves                          | Ample Reserves                                   |
| FFR set via OMOs                         | FFR set via IORB + ON RRP                        |
| $$Discount > FFR > IORB$$                | $$FFR \\approx IORB$$                             |

**Diagram (Conceptual):**

Corridor:  
Discount Rate (Ceiling)  
**↓**  
Fed Funds Rate  
**↓**  
IORB Rate (Floor)  

Floor:  
FFR **≈** IORB **≈** ON RRP  

## 🔓 SECTION 6: POLICY EFFECTS ON BALANCE SHEET

- OMO Purchase (Treasuries) **→** **↑** Reserves **→** **↓** FFR  
- **↑** Discount Rate **→** **↑** Ceiling **→** **↑** FFR  
- **↑** Required Reserve Ratio **→** **↑** Demand for Reserves **→** **↑** FFR  
- **↑** IORB **→** **↑** Floor **→** **↑** FFR (in floor regime)  

## 🔍 SECTION 7: THE 2008 CRISIS – ROOT CAUSES (TABLE FORMAT)

| **Event**                    | **Effect**                             | **Reasoning**                            |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Housing Bubble **↑**         | More ARMs and subprime loans issued    | Lenders believed home prices would keep rising |
| Bubble bursts               | Home prices **↓**                       | Supply of homes **↑**, demand **↓**         |
| Home prices **↓**            | Borrowers can’t refinance              | Loans exceed new home values (underwater) |
| ARM resets                  | Payments **↑**                         | Low initial rates expired                  |
| Payments **↑**               | Defaults and foreclosures **↑**        | Borrowers can’t afford new monthly cost    |
| Defaults **↑**               | ABS prices **↓**                       | Investors panic, try to sell               |
| ABS prices **↓**             | Bank losses **↑**                      | ABS held as bank assets lose value         |

## 🧷 SECTION 8: BASEL III – REGULATORY FIXES

| **Problem**            | **Basel III Solution**                                               |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Capital Risk           | $$\\frac{Equity}{Risk\\text{-}Weighted\\ Assets} \\geq 8\\%$$        |
| Liquidity Shortage     | LCR: Liquid Assets ≥ 30-day expected outflows                        |
| Funding Mismatch       | NSFR: Stable Funding ≥ Long-Term Assets                              |

## 🧮 SECTION 9: KEY EQUATIONS

1. **Capital Adequacy**  
   $$\\frac{Equity}{Long\\text{-}Term\\ Assets} \\geq 8\\%$$

2. **Liquidity Coverage**  
   $$Currency + Reserves + Treasuries + STA > 5\\% \\times Deposits$$

3. **Stable Funding**  
   $$Deposits + LT\\ Liabilities + Equity > LT\\ Assets$$

4. **Money Supply & Fed Funds Rate**  
   - In corridor system: **↑** Money Supply **→** **↓** FFR  
   - In floor system: **↑** Money Supply **→** no change in FFR (unless IORB adjusted)  

5. **Repo Impact**  
   - Repo **↑** **→** Fed Lending **↑** **→** Bank Reserves **↑** **→** FFR **↓**

|---------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Fed buys Treasuries (QE)                    | ↑ Bank reserves                           | FFR ↓, lending ↑                                 |

## 💣 6. During Crisis — What's Happening?

| **Crisis Trigger**                    | **Fed Response**       | **Balance Sheet Outcome**                                  |
|--------------------------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Banks can't roll ST debt             | Repo / QE              | Fed assets ↑, bank reserves ↑                               |
| MBS prices crash                     | Fed buys MBS (QE)      | Bank sells risk → gains cash & stability                    |
| Interbank market freezes             | Fed adds reserves      | FFR hits floor → lending shifts to private sector           |
| Fed balance sheet expands            | QE                     | System moves to floor regime                                |
| Fed balance sheet contracts          | QT                     | Liquidity ↓, rates ↑, risk re-enters banking system         |

## 🧪 7. Key Visual Cue for MCQs

- **If Fed buys something** → **assets ↑**, **reserves ↑**, **liquidity ↑**
- **If reserves ↑ a lot** → **floor system**, Fed must move **IORB** to adjust rates
- **If bank’s asset disappears** but liability remains → **capital risk**
- **If liability gone too** → only risk is **liquidity (short-term mismatch)**
- **If deposit limits are imposed** → bank relies on **hot money** → contagion risk ↑

---

## ✅ Final Tips

- Ask: **What’s the Fed buying/selling?** → Which balance sheet line changes?
- Look at **reserves** to judge if in corridor or floor
- Connect **asset sales/purchases** to **interest rates** or **risk transfer**
- Use the signal:  
  `Fed action → Bank reserve position → Lending → Interest Rate`
