This post summarizes key concepts from our capital budgeting and leasing lectures. It is structured for EMBA exam review and includes definitions, formulas, and logic behind financial decisions.

## 📌 Capital Budgeting vs. Capital Structure

**Capital Budgeting**: How firms choose investment projects.
- Tools: NPV, IRR, Payback, EAA

**Capital Structure**: How firms finance projects (debt vs equity)
- Tools: WACC, leverage ratios

---

## 💡 Key Definitions

**EBITDA** = Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization
- Proxy for operating performance

**Free Cash Flow (FCF)**:
$$
\text{FCF} = (\text{Revenues} - \text{Costs}) \cdot (1 - \tau_c) - \text{CapEx} - \Delta \text{NWC} + \tau_c \cdot \text{Depreciation}
$$

**Net Working Capital**:
$$
\text{NWC} = \text{Current Assets} - \text{Current Liabilities}
$$

**After-tax Salvage Value**:
$$
\text{After-tax salvage} = \text{Sale Price} - \tau_c \cdot (\text{Sale Price} - \text{Book Value})
$$

## 📉 Present Value of Cash Flows

From capital budgeting notes:
$$
\text{NPV} = -60,000 + 9,300 \cdot \frac{1 - (1 + 0.12)^{-8}}{0.12} + \frac{12,000}{(1.12)^8} = -8,954.35
$$
This includes:
- An annuity from cost savings: \$9,300 for 8 years
- A terminal value (salvage): \$12,000 in year 8

## ✅ Depreciation vs Lease Payment

- **Depreciation** is non-cash; used for tax shield only
- **Lease payment** is actual cash outflow

**Tax Shield**:
$$
\text{Tax} = -c \cdot \tau_c
$$

**Example**:
$$
\text{Tax} = -1,375 \cdot 0.34 = -467.50
$$

## 🆚 Lease vs Buy Framework

### Buy Case:
- Depreciation creates tax shield
- After-tax cash flows:
$$
\text{Cash Flow} = \text{Cost Savings} - \text{Tax (on EBIT)}
$$

### Lease Case:
- Lease payments are deductible
- After-tax cash flows:
$$
\text{Cash Flow} = (\text{Cost Savings} - \text{Lease}) \cdot (1 - \tau_c)
$$

## 💳 Present Value of Lease Payments

From lecture:
$$
PV = 0.2 \cdot \frac{1 - (1 + 0.05)^{-10}}{0.05} = 1.5443
$$
Use cost of debt (5%) to discount fixed lease payments.

---

## 📊 Equivalent Annual Annuity (EAA)

To compare unequal lives:
$$
a = PV \cdot \frac{i}{1 - (1 + i)^{-N}}
$$

**Example** (Machine A):
$$
a = 61.42 \cdot \frac{0.10}{1 - (1 + 0.10)^{-4}} = 19.376
$$

Interpretation: Investing \$61.42k yields \$19.38k/year for 4 years at 10%.

## 📐 Machine Comparison (NPV and EAA)

### NPV
$$
NPV_A = -80 + \frac{50}{1.1} + \frac{50}{(1.1)^2} + \frac{50}{(1.1)^3} + \frac{25}{(1.1)^4} = 61.42
$$

$$
NPV_B = -100 + \frac{60}{1.1} + \frac{60}{(1.1)^2} + \frac{60}{(1.1)^3} = 49.21
$$

### EAA
$$
a_A = 61.42 \cdot \frac{0.10}{1 - (1 + 0.10)^{-4}} = 19.376
$$

$$
a_B = 49.21 \cdot \frac{0.10}{1 - (1 + 0.10)^{-3}} = 19.738
$$

Even though NPV(A) > NPV(B), EAA(B) > EAA(A), so B is better if the project is repeatable.
