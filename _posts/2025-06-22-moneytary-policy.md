Monetary policy can seem complex at first — but once you break it down, the big picture becomes clear. In this post, I’ll summarize the core concepts from **Module 2: Monetary Policy**, including what I learned from our course and follow-up discussions. I hope this helps others preparing for the exam or trying to understand how central banking really works.

## 💡 Key Concepts from Module 2

### 1. 💵 Money, Deposits & Fractional Banking

#### 🔹 Monetary Base (MB)
$$ \text{MB} = \text{Reserves} + \text{Physical Currency (held by public)} $$
This is the total amount of "high-powered money" controlled by the central bank. It includes:
- **Reserves**: Cash held by banks in vaults or on deposit at the central bank
- **Physical Currency**: Cash and coins held by the public (not inside banks)

#### 🔹 Money Supply Measures

| Measure | What's Included |
|---------|------------------|
| **M1**  | 💵 Physical currency + 🏦 **Demand deposits** (checking accounts) |
| **M2**  | 🪙 M1 + savings accounts + small time deposits (CDs under $100K) + retail money market funds |
| **M3**  | 📊 M2 + large institutional deposits and less liquid instruments (no longer tracked by Fed) |

#### 🔹 Demand Deposits vs. General Deposits

- **Demand Deposits**:
  - Funds in **checking accounts**
  - Can be **withdrawn anytime**
  - Used for **everyday spending**
  - **✅ Counted in M1**

- **Other Deposits** (e.g. savings, CDs):
  - Not instantly spendable
  - May have withdrawal limits or penalties
  - **❌ Not in M1**, but included in **M2**

> ✅ Only demand deposits are considered "money" in the strict M1 sense, because they’re liquid and usable immediately.

#### 🔹 Fractional Reserve Banking
Banks are only required to keep a fraction of deposits as reserves. The rest is loaned out, which increases the money supply.

### 2. 🏦 Central Bank Tools & Implementation

- Central banks implement policy using:
  - **Open Market Operations**
  - **Overnight Lending Rate** (e.g. Federal Funds Rate)
  - **Discount Rate**
  - **Reserve Requirement** (rarely changed)
- More reserves = more lending = lower interest rates = more investment and spending.

---

### 3. 📉 AS/AD Curve Analysis

- **Aggregate Demand (AD)** = C + I + G + (X – Im)
- AD slopes down due to:
  - Wealth effect
  - Interest rate effect
  - Foreign exchange effect
- **Aggregate Supply (AS)** slopes upward (short run) and is affected by input costs, productivity, and regulations.
- **Shocks** to AD or AS shift the curves and impact GDP and price level.

### 4. 🎯 The Dual Mandate

The Federal Reserve is tasked with:
- **Price Stability**
- **Full Employment**

Key ideas:
- **NAIRU** = Natural rate of unemployment (too low = inflation risk)
- **Potential GDP** = Output at full resource utilization
- **Output gap** = Actual – Potential GDP
- **Stagflation** = Inflation + High unemployment (usually due to supply shocks)

---

### 5. 📊 The Taylor Rule

Used to guide interest rate policy:
$$ \text{Target Fed Funds Rate} = 1.5 \times \text{Inflation} + 0.5 \times \text{GDP Gap} + 1 $$

- "Inflation Hawks" prioritize inflation control (higher rates)
- "Doves" prioritize employment (lower rates)
- Taylor Rule suggests a balanced response to inflation and economic output

---

### 6. 🗣️ Central Bank Statements

Central bank language follows a pattern:
- **Business as Usual**
- **Wait and See**
- **Slow and Steady**
- **Time to Act**
- **All Systems Go**

Interpretation helps forecast rate decisions and economic direction.

## 🧠 Clarifications from Our Discussions

- **M1 is NOT MB + deposits**
  - ✅ M1 = Demand Deposits + Currency Held by Public
  - ❌ Reserves are not added again — they support the deposits

- **MB** includes reserves (bank-held) and physical currency (public-held), but not deposits directly

- **Only demand deposits** are part of M1
  - Savings, CDs → counted in **M2**

- **M1 vs M2 vs M3** help economists track how liquid the money is

---

## ✅ Example: MB and M1 in Action

Suppose Customer A deposits $1,000:
- Bank keeps $100 as reserves (10%)
- Loans out $900 → redeposited

Then:
- **MB = $100** (bank reserve only; public holds no currency)
- **M1 = $1,900** (all in demand deposits)

Reserves are **not** added again to M1 — no double-counting.

## ✍️ Final Thoughts

Monetary policy isn’t just theory — it shapes interest rates, job markets, and inflation. By understanding tools like the money multiplier, AD/AS analysis, the Taylor Rule, and how the Fed speaks through its statements, we get a clear view of how economies are managed.
