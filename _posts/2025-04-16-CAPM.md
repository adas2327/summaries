## 🧠 What Is the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)?

The **Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)** is a foundational framework in finance that tells you the **expected return** on an investment based on its **systematic risk** (market risk).

It helps you:
- Evaluate if an asset is fairly priced
- Decide how to allocate investments efficiently
- Compute the cost of equity for projects

---

## 📐 CAPM Formula

The CAPM equation is:

$$
E(R_i) = r_f + \beta_i (E(R_M) - r_f)
$$

Where:
- \( E(R_i) \): Expected return on asset \( i \)
- \( r_f \): Risk-free rate
- \( E(R_M) \): Expected return on the market portfolio
- \( \beta_i \): Asset's beta (its sensitivity to market movements)

This return is the **minimum** return investors demand for bearing the risk of asset \( i \).

---

## 🔎 What Is Beta?

Beta (\( \beta \)) measures the **systematic risk** of a security. It’s calculated as:

$$
\beta_i = \frac{\text{Cov}(R_i, R_M)}{\text{Var}(R_M)} = \frac{\sigma_i \cdot \rho_{i,M}}{\sigma_M}
$$

- \( \sigma_i \): Std. deviation of asset \( i \)
- \( \sigma_M \): Std. deviation of the market
- \( \rho_{i,M} \): Correlation between the asset and the market

---

## 🧰 Covariance — The Foundation of Beta

Covariance tells you how two variables move together:

$$
\text{Cov}(X, Y) = E[(X - E(X))(Y - E(Y))]
$$

Sample version:

$$
\text{Cov}(X, Y) = \frac{1}{n - 1} \sum (X_i - \bar{X})(Y_i - \bar{Y})
$$

---

## ⚖️ Sharpe Ratio — Return per Unit of Total Risk

Sharpe Ratio is:

$$
\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{E(R_P) - r_f}{\sigma_P}
$$

Where:
- \( \sigma_P \): Total (standard deviation) risk of the portfolio

It tells you: _how much return you earn for every unit of risk._

---

## 🎯 What Is an Efficient Portfolio?

An **efficient portfolio** either:
- Maximizes expected return for a given level of risk, or
- Minimizes risk for a given expected return

The collection of all such portfolios is called the **Efficient Frontier** — a curve shaped like the top half of a parabola.

---

## 🔺 The Tangent Point — The Best Portfolio

When you add a **risk-free asset** (like T-bills) to risky assets, the best portfolio is the **point of tangency** between the Efficient Frontier and the Capital Market Line (CML).

- This tangent portfolio has the **highest Sharpe ratio**
- It becomes the **Market Portfolio** in CAPM

---

## 📈 Capital Market Line (CML)

The CML shows combinations of the **risk-free asset** and the **market portfolio**. The equation:

$$
E(R_P) = r_f + \frac{E(R_M) - r_f}{\sigma_M} \cdot \sigma_P
$$

Where:
- \( \sigma_P \): Total risk of the portfolio
- CML applies **only to efficient portfolios** (those combining market + T-bill)

🟢 **Slope of the CML** = Sharpe Ratio of the Market

---

## 📉 Security Market Line (SML)

The SML shows the expected return for **any asset**, based on its beta:

$$
E(R_i) = r_f + \beta_i (E(R_M) - r_f)
$$

- Applies to all assets, efficient or not
- X-axis = beta (systematic risk)
- Y-axis = expected return
- **Slope** = market risk premium

---

## 🔄 CML vs. SML

| Feature            | CML                           | SML                            |
|-------------------|-------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Applies to        | Efficient portfolios only     | All assets and portfolios      |
| X-axis            | Standard deviation \( \sigma \) | Beta \( \beta \)               |
| Y-axis            | Expected return               | Expected return                |
| Slope             | Sharpe Ratio                  | Market risk premium            |

## 📌 What Happens When You Change the Stock Universe?

If you build an efficient frontier with:
- **500 stocks** (like S&P 500) → Better diversification
- **50 stocks** → Limited diversification

This changes:
- The shape of the frontier
- The tangent point (market portfolio)
- The slope of the CML

> **Conclusion:** The CML depends on what stocks you choose!

---

## ✅ What Makes Sharpe Ratio So Crucial?

Because the **tangent point** — the best portfolio — is the one with the **highest Sharpe Ratio**.

- Slope of CML = Sharpe of Market
- No other portfolio offers better return per risk

## 💬 Summary of Key Concepts

| Concept            | Meaning |
|-------------------|---------|
| CAPM              | Tells expected return given beta |
| Beta              | Measures systematic risk |
| Efficient Frontier| Best portfolios from risky assets |
| Tangent Portfolio | Highest Sharpe; basis of CML |
| CML               | Combines market + risk-free asset |
| SML               | Shows CAPM pricing across all assets |
| Sharpe Ratio      | Return per unit of total risk |
