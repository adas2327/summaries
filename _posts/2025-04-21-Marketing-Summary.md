## ✅ Session 1: Marketing Framework & Customer Value

### 🔹 Key Concepts

- **Modern Marketing = External Focus**
  - Long-term firm success = Delivering high value to customers.
  - Customer’s willingness to pay defines value, not the firm’s internal view.
  - Peter Drucker & Jeff Bezos quotes reinforce external orientation.

- **Value Proposition = Benefit to Customer − Cost to Customer**
  - Net Value to Customer = Total Benefits − Total Costs
  - Net Value of Customer to Firm = Revenue − Cost of Serving

- **Three Strategic Mistakes to Avoid**
  1. Being imprisoned by “here and now” (focusing only on current demand).
  2. Ignoring relationships among our own products (complementarity, ecosystem).
  3. Ignoring relationships among customers (network/social effects).

- **Primary vs. Secondary Demand**
  - **Primary Demand**: Growing the market (new customers or new uses).
  - **Secondary Demand**: Stealing share from competitors.

### 🔹 Analytical Models

#### 1. Multi-Attribute Model

- Treats a product as a bundle of attributes.
- Each attribute has an *importance weight* and *performance rating*.
- Formula:

$$
V_i = \sum_j w_j \cdot r_{ij}
$$

Where:
- $ w_j $ = importance of attribute $ j $
- $ r_{ij} $ = rating of product $ i $ on attribute $ j $

#### 2. Conjoint Analysis

- Regression-based approach to back out importance weights from preferences.
- Dummy variable coding: for $ n $ levels, use $ n - 1 $ dummy variables.

$$
Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i1} + \beta_2 X_{i2} + \dots + \beta_n X_{in}
$$

- Importance = range of part-worths (differences in coefficients).
- Useful for product design and pricing.

### 🔹 Case: Netflix

- Frameworks applied: Value to/from customer, demand types, segmentation.
- Demonstrated disruption, product and customer relationships, and the role of tech.



## ✅ Session 2: Customer Lifetime Value, Breakeven, Altius Golf

### 🔹 Key Concepts

#### 1. Pre-Purchase Funnel Behavior

- Steps: Need Recognition → Consideration → Info Search → Evaluation → Purchase
- Bottleneck analysis helps improve marketing strategies.

#### 2. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

- **Perfect loyalty**:
$$
\text{CLV} = \frac{C}{r}
$$

- **With defection rate** $ d $:
$$
\text{CLV} = \frac{C}{r + d}
$$

- **Net CLV**:
$$
\text{Net CLV} = \frac{C}{r + d} - a
$$

Where:
- $ C $ = contribution margin
- $ r $ = discount rate
- $ a $ = acquisition cost

#### 3. Breakeven Analysis

- Standard:
$$
\text{BEV} = \frac{\text{FC}}{\text{Price} - \text{VC}}
$$

- With profit target $ \pi_T $:
$$
\text{BEV} = \frac{\text{FC} + \pi_T}{\text{Price} - \text{VC}}
$$

### 🔹 Case: Altius Golf

- Strategic use of CLV, breakeven, cannibalization, alienation.
- Differentiated between high-end vs. fighting brand strategy.


## ✅ Session 2: Customer Lifetime Value, Breakeven, Altius Golf

### 🔹 Key Concepts

- • CLV Formulas:
- - Perfect Loyalty: CLV = C/r
- - With Defection: CLV = C / (r + d)
- - Net CLV = C / (r + d) − acquisition cost (a)
- • Retention impact and segment value differences
- • Breakeven Volume = FC / (Price - VC); Add πT for profit target
- • Case: Altius Golf – Cannibalization, alienation, strategic brand launch
