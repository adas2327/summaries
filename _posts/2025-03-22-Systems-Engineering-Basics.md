## **1. Tell Me About Yourself**
"I have spent over **15 years in the industry** working in **systems engineering and controls**, focusing on complex technical challenges in **automotive, heavy-duty vehicles, and electrification**. I also hold a **PhD**, and during my time in academia, I had the opportunity to **teach graduate-level courses**, which sparked my passion for education.

Currently, I’m a **System Architect at Volvo**, where I lead **cross-functional projects and technical strategy** for next-generation electric trucks. At the same time, I’m pursuing my **Executive MBA at Duke’s Fuqua School of Business** to build on my leadership and business acumen. Through this, I’ve realized how critical it is to **connect technical expertise with strategic decision-making**—something that this role at Duke perfectly aligns with.

With my **PhD, industry experience, and MBA**, I bring a unique perspective that can help strengthen **Duke’s Systems Engineering program** by integrating more **industry collaboration, real-world projects, and systems thinking** into the curriculum."

## **2. Summary of Systems Engineering Concepts in University Programs**
Systems Engineering (SE) is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on designing, integrating, and managing complex systems throughout their lifecycle. Universities typically follow a structured framework that aligns with industry standards (e.g., INCOSE SE Handbook, ISO 15288).

### **1️⃣ Core Principles of Systems Engineering**
✔ **Holistic Thinking** – Focus on the entire system rather than individual components.  
✔ **Lifecycle Approach** – Covers everything from conceptualization to disposal.  
✔ **Interdisciplinary Collaboration** – Brings together mechanical, electrical, software, and business disciplines.  
✔ **Trade-Off Analysis** – Evaluates cost, performance, risk, and sustainability factors.  
✔ **Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)** – Uses tools like SysML and Digital Twins for system modeling.  

### **2️⃣ Systems Engineering Process (INCOSE/ISO 15288 Framework)**
Most universities follow a structured SE process:

| **Phase** | **Description** | **Common Tools & Methods** |
|----------|---------------|----------------------------|
| **Concept Development** | Define needs, goals, and feasibility | Stakeholder Analysis, Market Research |
| **Requirements Analysis** | Capture system-level and stakeholder requirements | SysML, Use Cases, Functional Flow Block Diagrams (FFBD) |
| **System Architecture & Design** | Define system components, interfaces, and performance specs | MBSE, Digital Twin, Trade Studies |
| **Integration & Testing** | Verify that subsystems function together correctly | Simulation, Verification & Validation (V&V) |
| **Implementation & Deployment** | Manufacture, install, and roll out the system | Agile/Spiral Development, Configuration Management |
| **Operations & Maintenance** | Monitor performance, update, and troubleshoot issues | Reliability Analysis, Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) |
| **Disposal & Retirement** | Safely phase out the system | Sustainability & Lifecycle Cost Analysis |

### **3️⃣ Key Concepts & Topics Taught in SE Programs**
🔹 **Systems Thinking & Architecture** – Functional vs. Physical Architecture, Object-Oriented Systems Engineering, Trade-Off Studies & Optimization.  
🔹 **Requirements Engineering** – Functional & Non-Functional Requirements, Verification & Validation (V&V).  
🔹 **Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE)** – SysML, MATLAB, Simulink, Digital Twin Technology.  
🔹 **Risk & Reliability Analysis** – Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA), Probabilistic Risk Assessment (PRA).  
🔹 **Simulation & Optimization** – Monte Carlo Simulations, Systems Dynamics Modeling.  
🔹 **Project & Lifecycle Management** – Agile & Waterfall SE Methods, Cost-Benefit Analysis & Decision Making.  

### **4️⃣ Emerging Trends in Systems Engineering**
🚀 **AI & Automation** – Using AI for system optimization & predictive maintenance.  
🌍 **Sustainability Engineering** – Lifecycle analysis for eco-friendly system design.  
🔗 **Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS)** – Integrating IoT, Cloud Computing, and Embedded Systems.  
📊 **Big Data & Digital Twins** – Using real-time data analytics to improve system performance.  

### **How Duke Can Differentiate Its SE Program**
✔ **Stronger AI & Machine Learning Integration** in system design.  
✔ **More Hands-On Industry Projects** with real-world applications.  
✔ **Business & Leadership Courses** for engineers moving into executive roles.  
✔ **Advanced MBSE & Digital Twin Applications** to stay ahead of industry trends.
