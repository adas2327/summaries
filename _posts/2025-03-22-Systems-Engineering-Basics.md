## **1. Tell Me About Yourself**
"I have spent over **15 years in the industry** working in **systems engineering and controls**, focusing on complex technical challenges in **automotive, heavy-duty vehicles, and electrification**. I also hold a **PhD**, and during my time in academia, I had the opportunity to **teach graduate-level courses**, which sparked my passion for education.

Currently, I‚Äôm a **System Architect at Volvo**, where I lead **cross-functional projects and technical strategy** for next-generation electric trucks. At the same time, I‚Äôm pursuing my **Executive MBA at Duke‚Äôs Fuqua School of Business** to build on my leadership and business acumen. Through this, I‚Äôve realized how critical it is to **connect technical expertise with strategic decision-making**‚Äîsomething that this role at Duke perfectly aligns with.

With my **PhD, industry experience, and MBA**, I bring a unique perspective that can help strengthen **Duke‚Äôs Systems Engineering program** by integrating more **industry collaboration, real-world projects, and systems thinking** into the curriculum."

## **2. Why Are You Doing an MBA?**
"I have been in a **pure technical role** for the past **15 years**, and people see me as a **technical expert**. However, I have always been interested in the **business side of engineering** and problem-solving beyond technical aspects. Despite my interest, I found that when I approached business-related roles, **people didn‚Äôt fully trust me** due to a lack of formal business experience. 

I realized that an **MBA would provide me with the skillset** to successfully transition into business-related roles, where I can leverage my **technical expertise** in **systems engineering** to drive **business success**. A recent example is how I proactively joined a **business project at Volvo**, where I was asked to analyze the **addressable market and pricing strategy for a future BEV truck**. I immediately saw how my **marketing and data analytics knowledge from my MBA** was useful in shaping strategic decisions."

## **5. Differentiators (What Makes You Stand Out?)**
Since you come from industry, this is your chance to highlight why you bring a fresh perspective to an academic leadership role.

**Key Points to Emphasize:**
‚úÖ **Industry-Academic Bridge** ‚Äì You‚Äôve worked in cutting-edge engineering and safety systems (ISO 26262, electromobility). You can connect academic training to real-world industry needs.  
‚úÖ **Executive & Systems Thinking** ‚Äì Your cross-functional leadership at Volvo, experience managing projects across stakeholders, and your systems approach to problem-solving.  
‚úÖ **Strategic Mindset** ‚Äì How you‚Äôve driven process improvements, technical roadmaps, and business strategy in a corporate setting.  
‚úÖ **Duke Fit** ‚Äì Your EMBA at Fuqua gives you insight into executive education needs and how to develop programs that align with industry demands.  

**Possible Question: Why should we hire you over someone with more academic experience?**  
"I bring a strong blend of **industry experience and academic understanding**. Having led large-scale projects in **electromobility and safety**, I know what skills companies actually need from engineers today. My goal is to bridge that gap between **academia and industry**‚Äîensuring Duke‚Äôs **Systems Engineering graduates** are not just well-versed in theory but prepared for **leadership roles in top organizations**. Combined with my **Fuqua EMBA**, I bring both a **business and technical perspective** that is uniquely suited for this role.‚Äù
