## Interview Questions & Answers

### <span class="question">Why should we hire you over someone with more academic experience?</span>

<span class="answer">I bring a strong blend of industry experience and academic understanding. Having led large-scale projects in electromobility and safety, I know what skills companies actually need from engineers today. My goal is to bridge that gap between academia and industry—ensuring Duke’s Systems Engineering graduates are not just well-versed in theory but prepared for leadership roles in top organizations. Combined with my Fuqua EMBA, I bring both a business and technical perspective that is uniquely suited for this role.</span>

---

### <span class="question">How would you shape the Systems Engineering program at Duke to be more competitive?</span>

<span class="answer">My industry connections and leadership in the Heavy Duty Charging Consortium have shown me how to connect key players—academia, industry, and research labs. I would bring these skills to Duke to expand partnerships, attract top speakers, and create more immersive learning experiences.</span>

---

### <span class="question">Why are you doing an MBA?</span>

<span class="answer">I have been in a pure technical role for the past 15 years, and people see me as a technical expert. However, I have always been interested in the business side of engineering and problem-solving beyond technical aspects. An MBA provides me with the skillset to successfully transition into business-related roles where I can leverage my technical expertise in systems engineering to drive business success.</span>

---

### <span class="question">Why are you interested in the Executive Director role at Duke?</span>

<span class="answer">This role perfectly combines academia, technical expertise, and business leadership—all areas where I have experience and interest. My academic background is strong due to my PhD and teaching experience, and my industry expertise spans 15 years in systems engineering and controls. My business knowledge is growing through my Fuqua MBA, where I am learning to align engineering solutions with strategic business objectives.</span>

---

### <span class="question">What is the future of Systems Engineering?</span>

<span class="answer">The field is evolving rapidly with trends like Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE), interdisciplinary skillsets, and industry-academic collaborations. By integrating these into Duke’s curriculum, we can ensure students are at the forefront of engineering innovation.</span>

---

### <span class="question">What is your strongest skill?</span>

<span class="answer">My ability to break down complex problems into manageable pieces and approach them in an agile, structured manner. For example, at Volvo, I worked on a passive safety problem and simplified a complex issue into an efficient, scalable, and implementable solution.</span>

---

### <span class="question">What is your biggest weakness?</span>

<span class="answer">I am an introvert and sometimes find it challenging to start conversations in new environments. However, I am actively working on this by stepping out of my comfort zone, initiating more conversations, and engaging in networking opportunities.</span>

---

### <span class="question">How do your friends and colleagues describe you?</span>

<span class="answer">They often say I bring a sense of calmness and stability, even in stressful situations. For example, during my finance exam at Fuqua, a classmate wanted to sit next to me because she found my calm demeanor reassuring.</span>

---

### <span class="question">What's Your Vision for This Role?</span>

<span class="answer">My vision for this role is to:
1️⃣ Bridge Industry & Academia by integrating real-world projects into the curriculum.
2️⃣ Expand Interdisciplinary Learning with AI, MBSE, and systems optimization courses.
3️⃣ Enhance Student Engagement & Career Success through mentorship programs and networking events.</span>

## Budgeting Basics

✔ **Fixed vs. Variable Costs** – Fixed costs stay constant (e.g., salaries), while variable costs change (e.g., materials).
✔ **CapEx vs. OpEx** – CapEx includes long-term investments, while OpEx covers daily expenses.
✔ **Variance Analysis** – Compare budgeted vs. actual expenses to identify financial inefficiencies.
✔ **Top-Down vs. Bottom-Up Budgeting** – Leadership sets top-down budgets, while teams input into bottom-up budgets.
