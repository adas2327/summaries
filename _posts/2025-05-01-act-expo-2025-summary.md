## ⚡ Tesla’s 1.2 MW Charging System

Tesla introduced a **1.2 MW charger** for its **Semi trucks**, with 46 dedicated charging sites coming online.

- Based on what’s been shared publicly (including Wikipedia), this charger likely builds on Tesla’s **NACS standard**, possibly extended to higher power.
- It is **not confirmed to follow the CharIN-led Megawatt Charging System (MCS)** standard, suggesting Tesla is pursuing a proprietary path for now.

This positions Tesla Semi charging as **vertically integrated**, while other OEMs like Volvo, Daimler, and PACCAR are leaning toward **open standards like MCS**.

## 💧 Hydrogen: The Hype, Reality, and Hope

Hydrogen remained a centerpiece at ACT Expo — particularly for heavy-duty applications — but cost remains a significant obstacle.

| Metric             | Value       |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Current H₂ Cost    | ~$36/kg     |
| DOE 2030 Goal      | $5/kg       |
| Long-Term Target   | $2/kg       |

**Hyundai**, **Cummins**, and **Nikola** highlighted H₂ truck readiness and fueling solutions. However, infrastructure gaps and high production costs continue to limit scale.
