## ‚ö° Tesla‚Äôs 1.2 MW Charging System

Tesla introduced a **1.2‚ÄØMW charger** for its **Semi trucks**, with 46 dedicated charging sites coming online.

- Based on what‚Äôs been shared publicly (including Wikipedia), this charger likely builds on Tesla‚Äôs **NACS standard**, possibly extended to higher power.
- It is **not confirmed to follow the CharIN-led MCS (Megawatt Charging System)** standard, suggesting Tesla is pursuing a proprietary path for now.

This positions Tesla Semi charging as **vertically integrated**, while other OEMs like Volvo, Daimler, and PACCAR are leaning toward **open standards like MCS**.

## üíß Hydrogen: The Hype, Reality, and Hope

Hydrogen remained a centerpiece at ACT Expo ‚Äî particularly for heavy-duty applications ‚Äî but cost remains a significant obstacle.

| Metric             | Value       |
|--------------------|-------------|
| Current H‚ÇÇ Cost    | ~$36/kg     |
| DOE 2030 Goal      | $5/kg       |
| Long-Term Target   | $2/kg       |

**Hyundai**, **Cummins**, and **Nikola** highlighted H‚ÇÇ truck readiness and fueling solutions. However, infrastructure gaps and high production costs continue to limit scale.
